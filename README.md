# IE300_Case_Study1_Fastest_Flights_Two
Split into two parts, both handle CSV reading.
This is my second attempt because the first was not properly backed.

Part A:
Uses FlightTime.csv data and a
refresher on lists, dictionaries, and matplotlib plotting

Part B:
Uses FlightDelay.csv data and
implements a Naive-Bayes Classifier,
also uses conditional probability
